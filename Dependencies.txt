                 unzipped to C:\Boost\ and added to PATH)

                 built on the build slave from source using NASM and Strawberry Perl

CentOS 7
========
Tools:
    
    - CMake 3   (installed from the EPEL repository)

Precompiled:

    - Boost     (distro version (1.53.0) is too old, installed in to
                 /home/synergy/boost)

Linux (General)
===============
Strategy:
    
    - Using distro versions of everything, unless unavoidable.
    
    - Statically link C++ libraries like Boost unless they provide a stable
      ABI (Qt does, as does ZMQ (written in C++, but provides a C API which the 
      official C++ API uses under the covers))

macOS
=====
Precompiled:

    - Qt        (installed using the installer in to /Users/Synergy/Qt)
    - libsodium (installed with brew in /usr/local/)
